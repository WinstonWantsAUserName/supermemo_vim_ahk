Setting file to emulate vim with AutoHotkey, works with SuperMemo

# To Do

I apologise for still not wrote a documentation, the keybinds are fairly similar to Vim, except `q` for extract and `z` for cloze, so you can do stuff like `zt.` to cloze until end of sentence, and `qip` to extract inner paragraph. Vim-Sneak plugin is added as well, so you can do `d2sth` to delete until the 2nd "th".

If you have any questions, or you want to see any feature added, please contact me in Discord! (Winston#1395) Like any SuperMemo user, I am writing the documentation incrementally:)
